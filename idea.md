# Cascading Nested Threads

So a forum also known as a message board is a website of catagorys which have threads.

## Threads
Threads or posts are just blocks of text, the site will render them as markdown for formating and sort of attachments using markdown's embed links. Threads can be edited and deleted by the original poster ("op"). They can have replies too, and the op can lock the thread from getting more replies. This is the threads part.

## Nested
Like reddit, you can reply to a reply recursively. Unlike reddit, each reply is also it's own thread. This is the nested part. There is only one top level or root thread which all other threads will tree from.

## Cascading
The op of a parent thread is also a op of all it's replies. They can do almost all op actions on all threads that tree from it. The one thing they can't do is edit, only the author of a thread can edit it.

## More things

### Invited ops
Authors can invite other users to be a op on their thread. This only applies to the thread the author added the user as op to. Ops are still not authors, so they can't edit or add more invited ops to the author's thread.

### Private threads
This would use the invited ops as a member list, so basically op only threads. Private threads that have ops and members as separate roles are unnecessary.

### Op only threads
Read the above Private threads.

### Pinned replies
Also unnecessary, just edit in markdown links in the thread.

## Okay I read this now what
How good/bad was it? Let me know if there are any suggestions or issues with this.
